segments of robotics and motion, electrification products and industrial automation. 
 
• Revenue from operations (through sales of products and services) for Q2CY25 rose 
12% YoY to Rs. 3,145cr, with the electrification products segment contributing 43.8%.

22.2% YoY to Rs. 492cr. 
• EBITDA declined 21.6% YoY to Rs. 450cr in Q2CY25 despite a growth in the topline, 
primarily due to elevated cost of sales and increased operating expenses.

Outlook & Valuation 
ABB financial performance in Q2CY25 was subdued yet resilient, characterised by a 
healthy  growth  in  revenue  and  a  record-high  backlog  in  the  order  book.  The 
introduction of new products that are well-suited for the market is expected to bring 
in more growth, enabling ABB to gain market share and expand into new segments. 
Additionally,  the  company  views  easing  inflation  and  sustained  government 
expenditure  as  tailwinds.  However,  the  company  faces  challenges  with  price 
realisation,  particularly  in  the  motion  division,  due  to  intense  competition. 
Uncertainty  surrounds  private  capital  expenditure,  as  businesses  are  exercising 
caution  when  it  comes  to  spending  as  they  want  clarity  on  the  trajectory  of 
domestic and export markets. Considering these factors, we maintain our rating on 
the stock to BUY, with a revised target price of Rs. 5,801, based on 43x CY26E 
adjusted EPS.

Key concall highlights 
• In Q1, material costs were impacted by foreign exchange rates as the euro and Swiss franc (CHF) appreciated over 10%, affect-
ing hedging and import costs. Higher import content, needed to comply with the government’s Quality Control Order, also affect-
ed material costs, particularly impacting the motion and electrification businesses. 
• ABB has recorded its highest backlog of Rs. 10,664cr, which is roughly split 50-50 between large orders and product orders. 
This backlog will be delivered over 18-24 months.  
• The company is consistently expanding to Tier II and III towns, where it is experiencing strong demand. It is particularly gaining 
market share in Tier III and IV towns.  
• ABB expects minimal impact from the tariffs imposed by the US as only a minor portion of its 10% export revenue is from that 
country. Besides, around 90% of its revenue comes from the local market, making it a domestically focused organisation.  
• Base orders maintain their upward trajectory, with a 5% YoY increase, despite a decline in large orders when compared with the 
previous quarters. The demand for base orders remains strong in distribution channels, whereas large system orders are more 
volatile and reliant on government/private capital expenditure.
